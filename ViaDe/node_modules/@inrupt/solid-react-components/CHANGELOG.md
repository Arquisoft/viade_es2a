# Solid React Components Library

## 0.5.0 ( December 18, 2019 )

### Added

- FormModel component:
  - New component that renders a form from a Form Model
  - New components added to support the form model. The following list of components are all compatible with the Form Model:
    - Textbox
    - TextArea
    - Date / DateTime / Time fields, using [react-datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/)
    - Dropdown
    - Checkbox (Boolean, not tri-state)
    - ColorPicker, using [react-color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/)
    - Header (an `<h2>` tag rendered inside of the form)
    - Comment (a `<p>` tag rendered inside of the form)
    - Decimal / Float / Integer fields
    - Email field
    - Phone field
    - Multiple, a custom Form Model field that indicates the child element is repeatable
    - Group, an ordered set of fields that can be treated as a single sub-form

### Updated

- Notification class was updated to validate notifications when being read from an inbox. This way only compatible notifications are retrieved and the data is more predictable for display purposes
- Updated ACL class predicate from `acl:defaultForNew`, which is deprecated, to `acl:default`
- Renamed the rdf predicate prefix from `a` to `rdf` to align with standard convention

### Deprecated

- The ShExFormBuilder component is now deprecated in favor of the new FormModel component. The component remains in the library for now, but the documentation has been removed

## 0.4.4 ( August 14, 2019 )

### Added

- Access Control Library was added, which helps developers to manage file and folder permissions in a Solid Pod
- App Permissions Library to help manage application specific permissions
- New Notification Library:
  - Global Inbox Discovery helper
  - Inbox Creation tools - add a new inbox and delete an existing inbox
  - Send Notification to and delete Notifications from a particular inbox

## 0.4.3 ( June 18, 2019 )

### Added

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) support was added, as well as better ESLint rules

### Updated

- Autofill temporarily disabled in the ShexFormBuilder component to prevent issues with autosave and autofill competing with each other
- Many, many formatting changes across the site to comply with prettier and ESLint

### Fixed

- Adding a new email and phone number in the same session will no longer merge the fields together
- A conflict error is no longer shown when two people edit the form to the same value (since there is no conflict)

## 0.4.2 ( June 5, 2019 )

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where a blank field was being seen as "undefined"

## 0.4.1 ( June 5, 2019 )

### Updated

- ShexFormBuilder
  - LiveUpdate added to ShexForm, so any changes to the form data outside of the current application will immediately be displayed in the form in real time
  - Conflict Resolution added. If two users are editing the same field at the same time, incoming changes will be displayed to the second editor, to inform them that another change has occurred
  - Form now autosaves. Triggered by the onBlur event, any changes to a field will be immediately and automatically saved, rather than relying on a button to save everything at once. This is an optional form state, and can be turned on or off
  - New error messages added to handle new error events, such as conflicts
  - Refactors to the ShexForm components to account for new functionality

## 0.4.0 ( May 22, 2019 )

### Added

- New component: ShexFormBuilder
  - Builds a form from a ShEx shape
  - Supports:
    - Textbox
    - Select
  - Validates form data onSubmit against the ShEx shape requirements
  - View [Readme](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-react-components#ShExFormBuilder) for usage details

## 0.3.0 ( March 5, 2019 )

### Updated

### Fixed

- Webpack config updated to fix yarn demo build
- File Upload component will now create a new unique filename in the POD. This is to prevent naming collisions, which was causing some errors uploading files with the same name
