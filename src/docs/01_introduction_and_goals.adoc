== Introduction and Goals
Viade is a route management system which uses Solid and has been developed using the React framework.

=== Requirements Overview

[options="header",cols="1,5"]
|===
| Requirement | Description
| Routes | Mainly, Viade allows users to create routes by establishing the points that make up that route, store them in their own POD, view them on a dynamic map and share them with other users that they can add as friends.
| Decentralized architecture | The system is based on a decentralized architecture in which the data is stored in the user's own POD, so it is not the application who saves the data and it is the user who decides who can access it. This guarantees greater data privacy and is achieved by following the proposal created by SOLID.
| Files | Viade allows the user to share both routes and different types of files (images, videos, documents ...) with their friends. In addition, they will receive the corresponding notifications when something has been shared with them.
| Groups | It also allows you to create groups of friends with whom you can share both routes and different types of files (images, videos, documents ...).
| Interoperable | Since there are different Viade applications, each one created by a development group, one of the requirements for all of them is that they have to be interoperable with the rest. For this, a standard to be followed has been agreed and we have developed our Viade taking it into account. Therefore, Viade is interoperable and allows you to manage routes created by users who use different applications.

=== Quality Goals

Quality goals ordered by priority from more important to less important

|===
|Nr.|Quality|Motivations
| 1 | Privacy | The user data should be private and only them can share it, all the data should be stored in individual solid pods.
| 2 | Usability | The app should be simple to understand and to use. This app is meant for users with no technical knowledge
| 3 | Availability | The app and the user data should be available always
| 4 | Modularity | The app should be modular by using react components to build the app easily and efficiently
| 5 | Testability | The app should be able to be tested

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Experienced Users / Hikers | Refers to all users with experience in the world of trekking and traveling | Use the app as a tool to improve their experience thanks to all its features, keeping the simplicity
| Newcomers | It covers all new users in the theme of the application | Being able to learn to use the system intuitively and without any problem in spite of their low experience
| Project developers | They are the developer team who'll carry out the design and implementation of the project | Creating a system that meets the requirements and quality goals initially established throughout the whole development, dealing with any kind of issue, being able to solve them and learning from them
| Subject teachers | They guide and evaluate the development team and provide them the required frameworks to carry out the project. In addition to resolving all doubts that come up in the development process | They expect developers to learn to use and familiarize with new development environmets and technologies which are possibly new for them, also learning to deal with teamwork
| SOLID Community | All contributors and people related to the SOLID Project | They expect that anyone interested in the SOLID project ask them for help when necessary, apart from learning more about decentralized technologies, and giving them more importance
