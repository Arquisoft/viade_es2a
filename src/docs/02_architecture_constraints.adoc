== Architecture Constraints

These are the technologies we will use:

Solid based architecture::
_Solid is a set of modular especifications based on network technology, whichs gives the
users their own owners of their data, so their privacy is protected.
The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy._


React framework::
_It is a JavaScript library used to create user interactive interfaces.
It is based on encapsulated components which manage their own state and they are composed to create
complex user interfaces.
React allows you to design simple views for each application state, and it will update and render efficiently
the correct components whenever their data changes_
