== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

| **Entidad** | **Contexto**
| _Cliente_ | _Subir rutas a la aplicación y ver las rutas de otros usuarios._
| _POD_ | _Son el sitio donde los datos de las rutas son almacenados. Cada usuario tiene un POD, cada usuario decide dónde se guardan los datos._
| _Aplicación_ | _Intermediario entre los usuarios y los POD's. Los usuarios guardan sus rutas en los POD's a través de la aplicación._

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

The system is based on the SOLID architecture created by Tim Berners-Lee, which focus on the decentrilzation of the web. Each user of the application 
will have a SOLID POD linked to his account. In SOLID, a POD is the main unit of storage, it can be thought as a private webpage for each user. In your 
POD you can store all your information and also choose whether you want each piece of data to be public or private, and you can even choose who you want 
to share that information with.

So, as explained above, each user of the application has a POD of his own. The application has to be connected to the Internet in order to communicate with 
that POD, as it is sort of an online server containing your data. Once you are online, you can start uploading routes to your profile (The POD) and then 
choose which of your friends can view which route.

The web application itself will be written in Javascript using React, an open-source library that makes easier and more complete the process of setting up 
an user interface.
