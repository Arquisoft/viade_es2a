The system is based on the SOLID architecture created by Tim Berners-Lee, which focus on the decentrilzation of the web. Each user of the application 
will have a SOLID POD linked to his account. In SOLID, a POD is the main unit of storage, it can be thought as a private webpage for each user. In your 
POD you can store all your information and also choose whether you want each piece of data to be public or private, and you can even choose who you want 
to share that information with.

So, as explained above, each user of the application has a POD of his own. The application has to be connected to the Internet in order to communicate with 
that POD, as it is sort of an online server containing your data. Once you are online, you can start uploading routes to your profile (The POD) and then 
choose which of your friends can view which route.

The web application itself will be written in Javascript using React, an open-source library that makes easier and more complete the process of setting up 
an user interface.
