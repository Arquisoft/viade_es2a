== Building Block View

This setion consits of a decomposition of our system into building blocks, 
showcasing their inner dependencies.

=== Level 1
We begin the decomposition by displaying a whitebox description of the overall system
as Viade blackbox.

We have chosen a MVC Model-View-Controller arquitecture pattern for the 
system as it is one pattern we have worked with before and we are 
confortable with. In our case, the part of the react front-end is containing
both layers of the view and the controller, while the model layer is separated 
in the services that use pod storage libraries.

* Service is a component that will be in charge of doing the bussiness model.
It normally is called by a controller. It uses the repository to persist 
users data and its routes data.

* Repository is a component that receives information from the service and
performs operations to insert, modify o remove data of a POD.

=== Level 2
=== Whitebox Service

This are the services we expect to work with. In the future they may change
or it may increase the number of services.

Viade Services

* ServiceBase. This is all services super class, used to perform operations for permissions,
files, and all the data in common stored in the pod.
* RouteService. This service allows to operate with routes: obtain the routes of a user,
to publish one route, or delete it...
* UserService. It will be used for obtaining a username from its webId.
* GroupService. Service to get all groups, read, create, delete a group and those types 
of operations on groups.
* CommentService. In order to post a comment, delete it or read comments.
* FriendService. This will manage friendships between users, adding a friend, delete 
or obtain friends of a user.


=== Whitebox Solid Libraries

* SolidAuthClient. This is a  browser library that allows our Viade app to securely log in
to Solid data pods and read and write data from them.
* LDFlex for Solid. This library is a configuration of LDFex language for Solid. Comes with JSON-LD context,
a query engine solid-authenticated, and useful data paths for Solid.
* SolidFileClient. This JavaScript library has methods to create, read, and manage
files and folders from Solid Pods.
