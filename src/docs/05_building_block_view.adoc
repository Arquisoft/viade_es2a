== Building Block View

This setion consits of the static decomposition of our system into building blocks, 
showcasing their inner dependencies.

With this general view we aim to give an idea of our source code structure, so that
is is easily to understand without implementation details.

=== Viade Whitebox 

We begin the decomposition by displaying the white box of the overall system of Viade
application. In it we find its black boxes, that represent all the 
contained building blocks.

We have chosen the Flux arquitecture pattern for the 
system as it is one pattern we think that goes well with React.
It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a
 unidirectional data flow.
The part of the views are the functions that transform the model of
the virtual DOM, and the part of the services represent the model.

* Views will be in charge of doing the client-side web. It uses the 
services of stores to persist users data and its routes data.

* Services classes that receive information from the views and
performs operations to insert, modify o remove data from a POD.

* Utils contains GPX parser, definitions of modals, some common style for components, 
management of error showing. Also,is where the LDflex helper is located and some more methods for utilities of permissions and
notifications.

* Documentation is defined in the docs folder, and inside it there are many
arc42 files and another folder for images.

* High Order Components or HOCs where the loading of components is managed.

* Hooks is a folder containing the functionality of the build-in hook useEffect from React
that applies some effects for the mouse clicking.

=== Views

Views are composed of components grouped by containers, displayed using different layouts.

[options="header",cols="1,2,5"]
|===
| Blackbox | Description | Examples
| Containers | The containers are components formed by other components. In Viade could be a part of the page view or the whole page view. | Social, Login, MyRoutes, Register, Welcome, PageNotFound
| Components |  Components in our case are hooks, which we are using to divide parts of the code in a way that we can recycle them using them in other components or containers. | RouteView, RouteCreationPanel, Map, Multimedia, Notifications ...
| Layouts | We use layouts to distinguish between a logged user and a an anonymous user with a private layout, a public layout and a not-logged-in layout. | NotLoggedInLayout, PrivateLayout, PublicLayout
