== Building Block View

This setion consits of a decomposition of our system into building blocks, 
showcasing their inner dependencies.

5.1. Level 1
We begin the decomposition by displaying a whitebox description of the overall system
as Viade blackbox.

We have chosen a MVC Model-View-Controller arquitecture pattern for the 
system as it is one pattern we have worked with before and we are 
confortable with.

Service is a component that will be in charge of doing the bussiness model.
It normally is called by a controller. It uses the repository to persist 
users data and its routes data.

Repository is a component that receives information from the service and
performs operations to insert, modify o remove data of a POD.

5.2. Level 2
5.2.1 Whitebox Service

or it may increase the number of services.
