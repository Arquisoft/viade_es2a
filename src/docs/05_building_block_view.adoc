== Building Block View

This setion consits of a decomposition of our system into building blocks, 
showcasing their inner dependencies.

5.1. Level 1
We begin the decomposition by displaying a whitebox description of the overall system
as Viade blackbox.

We have chosen a MVC Model-View-Controller arquitecture pattern for the 
system as it is one pattern we have worked with before and we are 
confortable with.

Service is a component that will be in charge of doing the bussiness model.
It normally is called by a controller. It uses the repository to persist 
users data and its routes data.

Repository is a component that receives information from the service and
performs operations to insert, modify o remove data of a POD.

5.2. Level 2

We still havenÂ´t discuss about the actual organization of the implementation.

5.2.1 Whitebox Service
5.2.2 Whitebox Repository

The goal of this block is to provide basic CRUD operations.
It is the responsible of managing POD usage.
