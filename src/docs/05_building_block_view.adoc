== Building Block View

This setion consits of a decomposition of our system into building blocks, 
showcasing their inner dependencies.

=== Level 1
We begin the decomposition by displaying a whitebox description of the overall system
as Viade blackbox.

We have chosen the Flux arquitecture pattern for the 
system as it is one pattern we think that goes well with React.
It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a
 unidirectional data flow.
The part of the views are the functions that transform the model of
the virtual DOM, and the part of stores represent the model.

* Views will be in charge of doing the client-side web. It uses the 
services of stores to persist users data and its routes data.

* Stores/Services classes that receive information from the views and
performs operations to insert, modify o remove data from a POD.

* UserAuthenticationService. It will be used for autentification of users.
* RoutesService. This service allows to process routes.
* FriendshipService. This will manage friendships between users.
* TimelineService. To obtain a cronological list of routes published recently.

=== Whitebox Service

* ServiceBase. This is all services super class, used to perform operations for permissions,
files, and all the data in common stored in the pod.
* RouteService. This service allows to operate with routes: obtain the routes of a user,
to publish one route, or delete it...
* UserService. It will be used for obtaining a username from its webId.
* GroupService. Service to get all groups, read, create, delete a group and those types 
of operations on groups.
* CommentService. In order to post a comment, delete it or read comments.
* FriendService. This will manage friendships between users, adding a friend, delete 
or obtain friends of a user.

=== Whitebox Repository

=== Whitebox Solid Libraries

* SolidAuthClient. This is a  browser library that allows our Viade app to securely log in
to Solid data pods and read and write data from them.
* LDFlex for Solid. This library is a configuration of LDFex language for Solid. Comes with JSON-LD context,
a query engine solid-authenticated, and useful data paths for Solid.
* SolidFileClient. This JavaScript library has methods to create, read, and manage
files and folders from Solid Pods.
