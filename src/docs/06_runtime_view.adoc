These are some representations of the ViaDe scenarios.

=== Store information
It is a decentralized information storage system, in which users send the information to the app and save it in their respective POD

title Store information

actor UserX
participant app
participant UserX_POD
UserX -> app: share route infomation (photos, videos and comments)
app -> UserX: application response on sharement
app -> UserX_POD: store information
UserX_POD -> app: POD response
----
Initially, the user will have to log in, with an account with their own POD or using a POD provider. This POD is where all the information collected when using ViaDe will be saved.

=== Share information
To see the routes of your friends you will interact with the application and this will be the one that takes the information of your friends POD if you are allowed access to that information.
