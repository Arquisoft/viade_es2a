== Design Decisions

Below, there is a list of the design decisions we have taken so far. It is on continuous development, 
as some situations in which we have to make a choice might not have appeared yet, but do so as we go 
deeper in the building of the project.

.Usage of React over React Native
- Pros:
* The teachers are more able to help us with React than with Native, as they have not worked with the 
latter.
* Plenty of documentation and tutorials online, including some about converting React code into React 
Native.
- Cons:
* If we decided in the future to allow the app to work in mobile devices, we will have to convert our 
code to React Native. If we had started already in Native, this adaptation would not be needed.
