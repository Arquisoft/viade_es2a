|Usage of React over React Native
|Whole group
a|
* The teachers are more able to help us with React than with Native, as they have not worked with the 
latter.
* Plenty of documentation and tutorials online, including some about converting React code into React 
Native. 
a|
* If we decided in the future to allow the app to work in mobile devices, we will have to convert our 
code to React Native. If we had started already in Native, this adaptation would not be necessary.

|28/02/2020
|Usage of Google Maps API
|Whole group
a|
* Plenty of documentation, tutorials and examples of usage online, by far the most documented API related
to maps. 
* It has been used before by some group members, which makes it easier to have it working properly.
