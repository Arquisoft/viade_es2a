== Risks and Technical Debts

This is a table of the risks we have taken and the safeguards:

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Risk|Safeguard
|Working with people we have never worked with before|Maintain contact with the group through discord calls in addition to the weekly class time.
|Start doing the documentation before the code. We have been two weeks developing documentation without having touched a line of project code or have experience in solid or react. Short development time.|Start developing functional code as soon as possible.
|Use technologies that none of the group members know or have ever worked with them before.|Keep the project up to date learning about react and solid and not leave it behind.

Technical Debts

- We have not started coding, so we have no technical debt. Later in the project, this point will be deepened.
