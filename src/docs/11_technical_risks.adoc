This is a table of the risks we have taken and the safeguards:

|Risk|Safeguard
|Lack of interactivity with the other route applications, due to mismatches in the way the data is stored. |Make a standar with other groups, which can be found in https://arquisoft.github.io/viadeSpec/
|Hard and not intuitive interaction with the application. |Developing and taking decisions having user experience always in mind, avoiding adding complex features.
|React framework makes possible developing applications in a quick and easy way, among several reasons due the JavaScript-like syntax usage, which can make error debugging more difficult. |Using a continuous integration tool like travis, to automatically test every change before deploy.

Technical Debts

- This project is limited with a period of 3 months. We can't afford all the quality scenarios, so we need to take priorities.
- Multimedia route management could be better, we couldn't afford improving it due time deadlines.
- Services related code might be cleaned and refactored.
- Performance is not as good as we initially expected because we follow the viade specification in order to have interoperability
